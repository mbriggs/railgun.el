==========

Propel yourself through a rails project with the power of magnets

The goal of this project is to provide easy ways to get to the places you want to be.

```
NOT DONE - railgun-find-views - show a list of views railgun-find-controller  - jump to a given controller railgun-find-presenter   - jump to a given presenter railgun-find-helper      - jump to a given helper
railgun-find-model       - jump to a given model
railgun-find-schema      - find model entry in schema.rb file railgun-find-blueprint   - find the entry in blueprints.rb railgun-find-factory     - find the entry in factories.rb
```

gives a minor mode for rails projects to hang global keybinds, and nice ido completions of rails objects
